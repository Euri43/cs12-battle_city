CONTROLS

Tank Movement:

W - Up

A - Left

S - Down

D - Right

Spacebar - Shoots a Bullet

R - Revives Tank (assuming you still have lives remaining)

T - Restarts Game (only when no more lives are left or the home cell is hit by a bullet, whichever happens first)

Left Shift + Q - Cheat Code for 1 Extra Life (can be used only once per game; Example: You used it in the first level, then you made it to the next level. You are unable to gain another extra life by using the cheat code.)

0 - Reset during the game (in-game hard reset in case you want to restart all over again)

Powerup: The powerup appears in a random empty cell when you have killed at least half of the enemy tanks. If the player tank goes through the blue heart cell (the sprite for the powerup), the player gains an extra life. The extra life is carried over through the next level. You get to have only one powerup per level.

Stage Format: The stage file (stage_file.py) contains the controls for the movement of tank (WASD keys), the dataclasses for Tank, Bullet, Cell, and Level, and the class containing the map levels. The two map levels made are stored in a list, which are then imported by the main file (main.py) from the stage file.

Highest Phase Accomplished: Phase 3
